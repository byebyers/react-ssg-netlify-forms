# React Netlify Form

A drop-in all-in-one solution for getting Netlify Forms on React-based SSGs
(Gatsby, Next, etc..) including automatic honeypot protection üíØüìù

## Premise

The `<NetlifyForm>` is a turn-key solution to enable your Gatsby, Next, etc. site
with Netlify forms without having to worry about all of the details. Manage your
form's state however you prefer (a simple method shown below) then pass the value
collection to the component and let it handle the rest.

No need to configure anything in the Netlify UI, no need to worry about fetching
or endpoints. It's all included.

## Example

Simple form usage (https://react-netlify-form.demo.jon.fm)
```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react"
import { navigate } from 'gatsby'
import NetlifyForm from 'react-netlify-form'

const IndexPage = () => {

  // Post-Submit Navigate
  const postSubmit = () => {
    navigate('/hooray')
  }

  // Simple controlled form setup (Control your own state)
  const handleChange = e => setFormValues({ ...formValues, [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
  const [formValues, setFormValues] = useState({
    name: '',
    message: ''
  })

  return (
      <NetlifyForm formName="Very Simple Form" formValues={formValues} postSubmit={postSubmit} >
        <div>
          Your Name: <input type="text" name="name" value={formValues.name} onChange={handleChange} required />
        </div>
        <div>
          Message: <textarea name="message" value={formValues.message} onChange={handleChange} required />
        </div>
        <div>
          <button type="submit">Send</button>
        </div>
      </NetlifyForm>
  )
}
```
